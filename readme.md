# go-option

A library to abstract cli-option parsing in a sane/familiar way.


## alternatives

The golang `flag` import serves the same function but has its own unusual handling that is neither familiar nor simple.


## sales pitch

My library aims to make "flag" parsing familiar again, while simplifying it in every possible way.

- simple registration methods
- multiple accepted names (for short and long-hand)
- optionally exit on invalid flag(s) and display help
- optionally assume "h/help" to print usage (on by default)
